\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents a starting point for induction coupler technology. It describes the physics of spinning magnet arrays producing contactless forces and torques on any conductive target. Preliminary experiments verified and measured these forces. When coupled together, three or more arrays can produce three independent degrees of freedom in the plane above the target's surface.
Induction couplers offer the prospect of inter-body forces that enable close-proximity inspection of a large target vehicle by a smaller chaser spacecraft, all without mechanical contact. There are many paths for future induction coupler research that extend this key conclusion. The frequency response of the system and its sensitivity to system state and environment are important to future designs. This analysis considers only planar motion. However, remaining in that plane requires an actuator associated with that degree of freedom, and ideally the chaser spacecraft or inspection vehicle would exhibit full six-degree-of-freedom maneuverability.
